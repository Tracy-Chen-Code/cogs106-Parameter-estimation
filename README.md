# cogs106-Parameter-estimation
The three-parameter logistic (3PL) model describes the probability of a correct response. For this assignment, you will implement a simplified version in which the difficulty parameters 
 are known to be (2, 1, 0, -1, -2) in five conditions. Moreover, the person parameter 
 is fixed at 0. We will focus on estimating the discrimination parameter 
 for a single participant and the base rate parameter
